Team "we can't name ourselves that Paone will get mad" (or something like that)
Andrew Bukowski, Jim DeBlock, Josh Nachtigal

Why is this worth 100 points?
-----------------------------
We met all of the requirements and we had fun.

CSS3 Features used
------------------
A gradient was used for the background.
Animations were used for the scrolling memes.
Variables were used to change the background color when the game is lost.
Text effects were used for the rainbow title.

Javascript libraries
--------------------
We used EasyTimer.js, in order to implement a timer for our scoring.

What nifty features of your program were a bear to implement?
-------------------------------------------------------------
We had some trouble working with canvas, as the size did not work as expected.
Revealing the mine images.
The scrolling memes were difficult because they created a horizontal scroll bar when leaving the screen. Finding out how to stop this was a bit difficult.
